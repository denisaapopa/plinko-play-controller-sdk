The `PlayController` allows the user to:

- Select a currency.
- Adjust the play amount.
- Start a play (manual or auto).
- Cash out winnings.
- Toggle between manual play and autoplay.

## Context & Provider

### `AutoManualPlayProvider`

The `AutoManualPlayProvider` wraps the PlayController, managing both manual play and autoplay. It uses React Context to provide game state and actions throughout the component tree.

🔹 **Features of `AutoManualPlayProvider`**:

- **Manages Game Mode**: Switches between MANUAL and AUTOPLAY.
- **Handles Autoplay**: Sets the number of plays, tracks rounds, and stops automatically.
- **Provides Context:** Exposes state and functions for controlling play behavior.

## Props

### 1. `StylingProps`

Handles the styling-related properties for the component.

- **`panel` (optional)**: Custom styling for the play controller.

  - **`bgColorHex`**: Hex color for the panel background.
  - **`top`**: top margin for the panel relative to the window.

- **`dropdown` (optional)**: Custom styling for the play controller.
  - **`bgColorHex`**: Hex color for the panel background.
  - **`borderConfig`**: Hex color for each type of risk.

### 2. `CurrencyProps`

  - **`currencies`**: Array of available currencies that the user can choose from.
  - **`winText`**: The win amount during the playing.

### 3. `ActionsProps`

Defines functions for the user actions.

- **`onPlay`**: A callback function to trigger when the user starts a play.
- **`onAutoPlay`**: A callback function to trigger when the user starts autoplay. It accepts `selection` (an array of selected indices) and `callback` (a function to be executed once autoplay finishes).
- **`onCashout`**: A callback function to trigger when the user decides to cash out their winnings.

### 4. `PlaySettingsProps`

Handles game-specific settings and states.

- **`playOptions`**: An object containing the following properties:
  - **`isPlaying`**: Boolean flag indicating whether the game is currently in progress.
  - **`canCashout`**: Boolean flag indicating whether the user can cash out their current play.
  - **`disabledController`**: Boolean flag to disable all interactive elements in the component, preventing user interactions (e.g., when the game is in progress).
  - **`displayController`**: Boolean flag to determine if the play controller should be visible.
  - **`showAutoPlayToast`**: A function to show a toast message during autoplay. Accepts an object with:
    - **`type`**: Message type (`"success"`, `"error"`, `"warning"`, or `"info"`).
    - **`message`**: The message to display.
  - **`playHook`**: A hook providing the current play amount, play limits, and a function to set the play amount.

    onPlay: () => console.log("Play button clicked"),
    onAutoPlay: (selection, next, stop) => {
      console.log("Auto Play started with selection:", selection);
      next(); // Proceed to the next autoplay round
      stop(); // Stop autoplay (e.g., in case of an error or when the user chooses to stop)

    onCashout: () => console.log("Cashout clicked"),
    playOptions: {
      displayController: true,
      canCashout: false,
      isPlaying: false,
      disabledController: false,
      showAutoPlayToast: (props) => {
        console.log(`${props.type}: ${props.message}`);
      },
      playHook: () => {
        return {
          playLimits: { min: 1, max: 100 },
          playAmount: 10,

  return (
    <AutoManualPlayProvider config={config}>
      {({ autoPlay: { selection, setSelection, state }, mode }) => (
